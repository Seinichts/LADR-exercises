\section{The vector space of linear maps}

\begin{problem}
Suppose \(b,c \in \R\). Define \(T : \R^3 \to \R^2\) by \[
T(x,y,z) = ( 2x - 4y + 3z + b, 6x + cxyz).\]
Show that $T$ is a linear map if and only if \(b = 0\) and \(c = 0\).
\end{problem}


\begin{proof}
Consider \(T(1,1,1) = T(1,0,0) + T(0,1,1)\)
\begin{align}
  T(1,1,1) &= (1 + b, 6 + c) \\
  T(1,0,0) &= (2 + b, 6) \\
  T(0,1,1) &= (-1 + b, 0)
\end{align}
Therefore, \(b=0, c=0\)
\end{proof}
