% Problem 1

\begin{problem}{1}
  Find all vector spaces that have exactly one basis.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
\par Consider all lines passing through origin.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Let $U$ be the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^5$ defined by
\[ U = {(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) \in \mathbb{R}^5 : x_1  = 3 x_2 \text{ and } x_3 = 7 x_4}\]
Find a basis of $U$.
\item Extend the basis in part (a) to a basis of $\R^5$.
\item Find a subspace $W$ of $\R^5$ such that \( \R^5 = U \oplus W\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item We can verify that \((3, 1, 0, 0, 0), ~ (0, 0, 7, 1, 0), ~ (0, 0, 0, 0, 1)\)
is a basis of $U$, and it spans U.
\\ Idea: We start from the basis of $\R^5$ and try to fit it into the given condition.

\item \((3, 1, 0, 0, 0), ~ (0, 0, 7, 1, 0), ~ (0, 0, 0, 0, 1), ~ (0, 1, 0, 0, 0), ~ (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)\)
\\ Idea: Downgrade all vector to one dimensional (to obtain the basis of $\R^5$).

\item \( \Span\{(0, 0, 0, 0, 1), ~ (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)\} \)
\\ Idea: Refer to the definition of direct sum.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{5}
  Prove or disprove: there exists a basis \(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3\) of \(\mathcal{P}_3 (\F)\)
  such that none of the polynomials \(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3\) has a degree 2.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider
  \begin{align*}
    p_0 &= a_1 \\
    p_1 &= a_2 x \\
    p_2 &= a_3 x^3 \\
    p_3 &= a_4 x^2 + a_5 x^3
  \end{align*}
  It is easy to verify that they are linearly independent, and span $\mathcal{P}_3(\F)$
\end{proof}
