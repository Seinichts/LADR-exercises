\section{Polar Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition}

\begin{problem}{1}
	Fix $u, x \in V$ with $u \neq 0$. Define $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ by \[
		Tv = \left< v, u \right> x
	\]
	for every $v \in V$. Prove that \[
		\sqrt{T^* T}v = \frac{\left\| x \right\|}{\left\| u \right\|} \langle v , u \rangle u
	\] for every $v \in V$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  First we need to find the $T^*$. By definition, we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
			\langle v , T^*w \rangle &= \langle Tv , w \rangle \\
			&= \langle \langle v , u \rangle x , w \rangle \\
			&= \langle v , u \rangle \langle x , w \rangle \\
			&= \langle v , \langle w , x \rangle u \rangle \\
			&= \langle v , Tw \rangle \\
			T^* v = \langle v , x \rangle u
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
	Then \begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		 T^*T v &= T^* \langle v , u \rangle x \\
		 &= \langle v , u \rangle T^* x \\
		 &= \langle v , u \rangle \langle x , x \rangle u \\
		 &= \langle v , u \rangle \left\| x \right\|^{2} u
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
	Notice that the first two terms are scalars,
	the eigenvector could only be $u$ and its eigenvalue
	is $\langle u , u \rangle \left\| x \right\|^{2} = \left\| u \right\|^{2} \left\| x \right\|^{2}$. \\
	Thus, $\sqrt{T^*T}v = \frac{T^*T v}{\sqrt{\lambda}} = \frac{\langle v , u \rangle\left\| x \right\|^{2} u}{\left\| u \right\|\left\| x \right\|}
	= \frac{\left\| x \right\|}{\left\| u \right\|}\langle v , u \rangle u $
\end{proof}
