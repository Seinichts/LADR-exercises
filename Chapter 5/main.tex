\section{Invariant Subspaces}

\begin{problem}{6}
Prove or give a counterexample: if $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ that is invariant under every operator on $V$, then $U = \{0\}$ or $U = V$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
Because every operator on $V$ leaves $\{0\}$ invariant, the question turns to prove the existence of an operator under which only $\{0\}$ and $V$ is invariant.

The case where $\operatorname{dim} V \le 1$ is trivial.
Suppose $\operatorname{dim} V \ge 2$. We could always construct such an operator $U$. Suppose there exists an invariant subspace $U_1$ of $V$ under an operator $T$ that is neither $\{0\}$ nor $V$ for which $\operatorname{dim} U_1 < \operatorname{dim} V$. Define $T$ which rotates $U_1$ to $W$, where $W \oplus U_1 = V$. $\forall u \in U_1, T(u)$ have some component in $W$, which is not in $U_1$. Thus, $U$ is not invariant under $U$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $U = \{0\}$ or $U = V$.
\end{proof}
